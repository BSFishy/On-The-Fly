# The On The Fly Library [![Build][3]][2] [![Download][4]][5]
This is a library for Minecraft Forge, to allow for general aspects, such as blocks, items, and entities to be changed and added during the runtime. This project is still in alpha, because of the fact that it is not finished.

To learn more, or to learn how to use the library, go to the wiki.

# **NOTICE**
**The On The Fly Library uses the Forge registry system in an unsupported way. If you have any issues, or anything breaks, that is my fault, and not Forge's. With that said, if you get any errors, please report them on our [issue tracker][1].**
