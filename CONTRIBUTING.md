# Contributing
Hello. If you are looking at this file, you must be expressing interest in helping with the On The Fly project. Great! There are a few guidelines to know before you start with your contributions. Check the out below.

## Checkstyle
We use the Gradle Checkstyle plugin. This keeps our code looking the same throughout the code. This will only take effect when compiling the code, so you are required to compile the code before you request to make a change. One thing that is for sure, is that if you right click a file in Intellij Idea, and select the "Reformat code" option, and click the Ok button, that will fix any errors caused by the checkstyle plugin.

## Miscellaneous
Since we want to give credit to everyone that helps, we have a CONTRIBUTORS file. Feel free to add yourself there to prove that you have read this file. Also there is a CHANGELOG file. Please add your name and a short description to that file under the latest release. Use this format for that file:

     + [description] - [your username]

## Lombok
We use a plugin called [Lombok][1]. It greatly simplifies our code, and reduces the amount of code written by a lot! If you do not have the Lombok plugin installed for your IDE, you might get some issues. Please install the plugin, to ensure that you do not have any errors in your files.

## Conclusion
That is it! If you have a working contribution, simply add make a pull request, and if we feel it is a valid contribution, we will accept it. Thank you for your time reading this!
